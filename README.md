# PAMGuard_DeepLearningSegmenter
The Deep Learning Segment PAMGuard module acquires incoming chunks of raw sound data and sends to a deep learning model for classification in real time. Results become part of the PAMGuard processing chain and so can be further classified, saved as raw wav clips, localised, annotated etc. 

## Introduction 
[PAMGuard](https://www.pamguard.org/) is a bioacoustics toolbox for the detection, classification and localisation of soniferous species both in real time and post processing sound files. It's primarily focused cetaceans (whales, dolphins, river dolphins, porpoises) and bats however can be used with any vocalising animal. The modular structure of PAMGuard allows users to create processing chains for detection, classification and localisation which is combined with a comprehensive data management and visualisation system. This allows users to analyse and then visualise and navigate through months and years of acoustic recordings. 

So far PAMGuard has mainly used more traditional detection and classification algorithms (e.g. energy detectors) and some machine learning approaches (e.g. whistle classifier, ROCCA), however, has yet to fully integrate deep learning. The powerful data visualisation tools and real time capability of PAMGuard mean it is an ideal platform to integrate deep learning classifiers. Such algorithms greatly enhance automated classification performance and, if combined with PAMGuard, could be integrated into an acoustic analysis workflow with a wide variety of conservation applications, for example, improving real time mitigation and enabling more streamlined analysis of large acoustic datasets. This plugin PAMGuard module provides a framework to integrate deep learning classifiers which analyse any detection or data stream that can provide raw data. That means it works on continuous sound data, clips, clicks or other data that holds a raw waveform. 

## Frameworks and Models
The structure of the module is as follows. 

1) Data segmentation: here raw sound data is segmented into chunks with a specified chunk and hop size.
2) Data transforms: the chunks are sent to a list of data transforms that convert the raw wave data to an input acceptable for the model
3) The deep learning model: passes the transformed data to the model and waits for a result.
4) Data packaging: packages the results into a data unit which is passed onto PAMGuard's displays and downstream processes.

_A diagram of how the deep learning module works in PAMGuard. An input waveform is segmented into chunks. A series of transforms are applied to each chunk creating the input for the deep learning model. The transformed chunks are sent to the model. The results from the model are saved and can be viewed in real time (e.g. mitigation) or in post processing (e.g. data from SoundTraps)._

The module is based on AWS's [deep java library (djl)](https://djl.ai/) and [JPAM](https://github.com/macster110/jpam) which does most of the heavy lifting loading and running models and is model independent i.e. you can use models trained in PyTorch, Tensorflow etc. The main job of the PAMGuard module is therefore to convert the raw sound data into a format suitable for a loaded model and provide a user interface. The deep learning module is designed primarily to work with existing model frameworks - i.e. used in conjunction with libraries that are used to train different models that package the required metadata for transforming acoustic data into the model.

## Deep Learning Models

### Generic Model
A generic model allows a user to load any model compatible with the djl (PyTorch (JIT), Tensorflow, ONXX) library and then manually set up a series of transforms using PAMGuard's transform library. It is recommended that users use an existing framework instead of a generic model as these models will automatically generate the required transforms. 

### AnimalSpot
[ANIMAL-SPOT](https://github.com/ChristianBergler/ANIMAL-SPOT) is a deep learning based framework which was initially designed for [killer whale sound detection]((https://github.com/ChristianBergler/ORCA-SPOT)) in noise heavy underwater recordings (see [Bergler et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47335-w)). AnimalSpot has now been expanded to a be species independent framework for training acoustic deep learning models using PyTorch and Python. Imported AnimalSpot model will automatically set up their own data transforms and output classes. 

### Ketos
[Ketos](https://meridian.cs.dal.ca/2015/04/12/ketos/) is an acoustic deep learning framework based on Tensorflow and developed by Meridian. It has excellent resources and tutorials and Python libraries can be installed easily via pip. Imported Ketos model will automatically set up their own data transforms and output classes. 

## Deep learning module quick start

### Installing the module
The module is now a core module in PAMGaurd and will be released with version 2.01.06. 

### Adding to PAMGuard's data model
The module is straightforward to use. Go to _File ->Add Modules -> Classifiers -> Raw Deep Learning Classifier_. This will add the module to the PAMGuard data model. Once the module has been added to the data model go to  _Settings -> Deep Learning Segmenter_ to open the module settings. Select the channels, window length, hop size and deep learning model and you are ready to start analysing data.

_An example the user interface for loading a model. The module allows a users to select a model framework and then load a model file. The model will generate a list of transforms that convert the raw sound data to a suitable input. Users have the option to edit transforms associated with a loaded model if necessary._
